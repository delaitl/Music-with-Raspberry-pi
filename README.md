# AD9850-with-Raspberry-pi
This project deals with the use of integrated circuit AD9850 with Raspberry pi to 
  1) Create a sinus signal with desired frequency at the output of the system (generator.py)
  2) Play the song fr√®re Jacques (frere_jaques.py)

The AD9850 is a highly integrated device that uses advanced DDS technology coupled with an internal high speed, high performance D/A converter and comparator
to form a digitally programmable frequency synthesizer and clock generator function.

The main interest of this project is to allow the creation of an analogic oscillating signals using the raspberry Pi architecture that only deals with digital circuits.
